# Project-1-War-Game

The project is the famous card game called war. We use JavaScript, HTML and CSS to build this game.

How to play the game:
Both players place the top card of their deck onto the center of the table. The player whose card is higher in value takes both cards and places them in a separate pile next to their deck. Once a player runs out of cards in their deck, they shuffle all of the cards in their win pile and continue to play.

If players play cards of the same value, then there is a war. Players will place three of their cards faced down on the table and draw again. The winner of the war takes the three cards faced down, winning 3 of their opponentâ€™s cards. If both cards of the second draw are also equal, the process is repeated and three more cards are laid faced down.

The player who wins all of the cards, wins the game.

Things to add and improve:
- The basic design of the game.
- make it more interactive. 
- Using OOP.
